# google-homepage
I tried to recreate the search page of google with my 1 month of learning web development via The Odin Project.

I have been stalling on doing this short project for a while because the time I use to learn programming involves me sitting at my office while students I teach are on summer vacation, so I didn't want to plug in earbuds to watch the video tutorials that would show me how to use tools like the dev tool kit, which made the project considerably easier, and now I feel like I have a better understanding of how to move objects around on a page. 

Basic skills used included setting objects to a block, inline-block, resizing via css, and most importantly simple stylings with css.
